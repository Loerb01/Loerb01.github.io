			I have a problem with the people who invent and use genre terms based on 'cybepunk'. In particular the
			terms that fall under the 'hopepunk' umbrella, and to a lesser extent the ones that ignore or minimize the
			'punk' part of their monikers. I find it to be a bastardization of the original meaning of cyberpunk and (
			I can't believe I'm saying this), it's just not punk.
		</p>
		<p>
			Let's start with with the origin of the term. According to <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/cyberpunk">
			Merriam Webster</a>, and what I often see described in other places, the term is a <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/portmanteau">
			portmanteau</a> of two words. "Cybernetics" (I've seen some variance with this one, but such differences are
			unimportant to this article) and "Punk". While the early progenitors of the cyberpunk genre existed as early
			as the 1940s and 1950s, punk culture didn't emerge until the 1970s where is kept increasing in popularity
			before (it feels like) it peaked in the early 2000s and then took a quick dive in popularity.
