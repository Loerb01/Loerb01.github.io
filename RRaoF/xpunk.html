			I have a problem with the people who invent and use genre terms based on 'cybepunk'. In particular the
			terms that fall under the 'hopepunk' umbrella, and to a lesser extent the ones that ignore or minimize the
			'punk' part of their monikers. I find it to be a bastardization of the original meaning of cyberpunk and (
			I can't believe I'm saying this), it's just not punk.
