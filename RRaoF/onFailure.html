		<h1>On Failure</h1>
		<p>
			I would like to preface this article/essay (but too short)/ramble with the explicit acknowledgement of
			intention not to narrow, nuance, or refine a/the/your definition of failure, but to widen it. I write this
			having walked home early and alone because we (my family) got "held up" at an open mic event where multiple
			friends and their friends were playing. I'm happy to support them, but we had originally intended to see a
			specific (and very good) band playing ~3 buildings down the street, but by time I decided to leave it
			appeared that I would only be able to attend the last ~15min of the set (which I was already familiar with
			and uninterested in seeing again).
		</p>
		<p>
			I consider the night a failure. I don't think I, or anyone else, failed. I don't think there was necessarily
			a wrong decision involved. I consider it a failure all the same, and like everyone says and the movies, and
			books, and songs, always talk about; failure is OK. The difference is, I mean it. failure is pervasive.
			Every time you cough, that means that you have failed to defend your body and the air it breaths and things
			it absorbs. But that doesn't necessarily mean that it's worth thinking agonizing over, or maybe even
			necessarily considering. If you cough a lot, then it may be time to consider why, and what could have been
			done differently.
		</p>
		<p>
			My greater point is that the spectrum of things that could be considered failure is wide and includes many
			things more minor than people usually bother to think about. Many failures in the world are so small that
			people don't bother to register them as such, assuming they even register them at all. Some failures are
			large (wars and genocides), but far greater are the small ones (a bacteria being eaten by a stronger
			bacteria) that just don't matter. So, when I say "failure is OK", I truly mean it, because it is pervasive
			and constant but mostly so inconsequential that you don't even bother to notice. So I leave you with a
			challenge; the next time something doesn't go your way, or is off of how you planned it, think hard and see
			if it should maybe be considered a failure. If so, don't try to justify it or come up with a reason that it
			was for the best, but just sit with it and accept it. As you do, try to realize the other small failures
			around you, the ones that are so small they don't register until you do this exercise. Don't spin this into
			a scale of the universe thing, just realize that it is all around you, and you are part of it. Then, move
			on. Because that's all there is.
