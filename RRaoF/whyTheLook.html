		<h1>Q: Why does this website look like this?</h1>
		<h2>A: Mostly because I'm lazy</h2>
		<p>
			For a longer answer I would reccomend starting with <a href="https://www.stroustrup.com/bs_faq.html#looks">
			Bjarne Stroustrup</a>, <a href="https://motherfuckingwebsite.com/">motherfuckingwebsite</a>, and
			<a href="http://bettermotherfuckingwebsite.com/"</a>bettermotherfuckingwebsite</a>. To be a bit more specific,
			I'm not a web dev/designer, or anything close to that, other than something casual like this. In fact, I
			actually dislike and take issue with many modern sites. Sure many of them look quite nice, but
			<a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/scrolljacking-101/">scrolljacking</a>, incessant cookie
			notifications, and generally busy desings unnecessarily take up computer power, brain power, and my patience.
			It's probably a bit overcompensatory, but I refuse to contribute to the problem. I have come to believe that
			the internet is actively becoming more hostile to users both purposefully and more often due to design that
			is ignorant of resources that tend to have limits such as bandwith and personal computer power. All that
			being said, I still include a small bit of CSS for personal preference reasons (mostly to use a sans-serif
			font, which is a rant for another time), but if you aren't a fan <a href="https://github.com/openstyles/stylus">
			change it</a>, I encourage you. If you particularly like your changes, feel free to send them to me.

			All that being said, please don't let it distract you from that original answer. I'm mostly too lazy to
			do more, but I'm ok with that because I don't think it is, or should be, necessary.

			P.S. Even if I do style this site more one day, I still plan on avoiding Javascript like the plague. It is
			a mistake to use, especially with things as wide spread as webpages.
