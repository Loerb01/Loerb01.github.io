			<dt><h2><a href="https://www.amazon.com">Amazon</a></h2></dt>
				<dd>Kinda an obvious one, but the cheap prices, huge variety of 3rd party sellers and 2 day shipping on
				most items, if you are one of the many with amazon prime, isn't to be over looked. Do note; it can be
				hard to find things even just bordering on niche/specific, and buying small volumes/individual
				components is a good way to waste money here. Go here for variety, consider Digikey, Mouser, or Arrow
				for specifics.</dd>

			<dt><h2><a href="https://www.arrow.com/">Arrow</a></h2></dt>
				<dd>Not a preferred vendor compared to digikey or mouser, but they exist...</dd>

			<dt><h2><a href="https://www.digikey.com/">Digikey</a></h2></dt>
				<dd>General vendor mainly catering toward industry with a huge catalog. Also provides datasheets and
				other relevant info as maid available by the manufacturers. Usually my go to for ordering specific
				parts.</dd>

			<dt><h2><a href="https://www.mouser.com/">Mouser</a></h2></dt>
				<dd>Very similar to digikey but may have slightly different parts. If you can't find something on one,
				check the other.</dd>

			<dt><h2><a href="https://www.adafruit.com/">Adafruit</a></h2></dt>
				<dd>Always something cool here, a true haven for hobbiests. Items range from kits, to pre-assembled.
				Also has some loose parts and specialty items that may be difficult or impossible to find elsewhere
				(without buying 100-1000).</dd>

			<dt><h2><a href="https://www.sparkfun.com/">Sparkfun</a></h2></dt>
				<dd>Similar to adafruit, but with a slight preference toward bits and pieces. Also has many useful
				guides, and somtimes arduino libraries, even for things that can be easily obtained elsewhere.</dd>

			<dt><h2><a href="https://www.mcmaster.com/">McMaster-Carr</a></h2></dt>
				<dd>NOT a place for electronics. That being said; screws, mechanisms, bits'n'bobs galore. Not always the
				best price but almost always the best selection. Enough options to make your head spin. Targeted at
				industrial applications, even if you don't buy it from here it's a good place to figure out how to look
				for it.</dd>

			<dt><h2><a href="https://www.ifixit.com/Store">IFixIt</a></h2></dt>
				<dd>Known for their how to fix guides, IFixIt's selection of tools and specific device parts is
				amazing, worth note, and often the only easily accessible place to fix your phone/tablet/other device
				not meant to be repaired. Their tools are also generally great quality at a good price. If you ever get
				into small device repair (laptop or smaller) grab one of their screw driver sets sooner rather than
				later. Also a good place to find niche tools
				(<a href="https://www.ifixit.com/products/tri-point-y00-screwdriver">tri-point</a> screw driver?).</dd>
