		<h1>Welcome to my procrastination station!</h1>

		<h3>About Me</h3>
		<p>I am Leonard Ch&#233 Romain Brown, better known to most as just Leo. I am a 3<sup>rd</sup> year computer
		engineering student at the Rochester Institute of Technology. I like working in low level languages such as C
		and the various dialects of assembly, and particularly despise higher languages such as python. You can check
		out my mostly unfinished C projects in my main github <a href="https://github.com/Loerb01">here</a>.</p>

		<h3><a href="whereToShop.html">Leo's List of Where to Buy Electronics</a></h3>
		<p style="margin-left: 3em;">I was sitting in a class where someone asked where to buy a component and I
		realized that there are a few great websites that people may just not know about. This is hopefully a running
		collection of some of them.</p>
